How to upload code to pypi


**Remember to switch the version file in the .toml within Github to a higher version

This method requires a specifically formatted folder. There is one large folder(which will be your overall directory in
Github, mine is "LN2_Monitory"), and inside that large folder there is: 
a pyproject.toml(example format in Github), an optional liscense, .gitignore, read me, and 
a folder for your project(mine is "ln2_monitor") containing an __init__.py your project (mine is "d1.py")

Download the zip file of the updated project from github and unzip(extract all) the contents. Change the directory to wherever 
the unzipped folder is, change the directory again to the folder within the overall folder 
(cd LN2_Monitor-main, cd LN2_Monitor-main)(switch to the folder within the large overall folder in the directory
and run the following:

Run "python3 -m pip install --upgrade build" and "python3 -m build"

Then from the same directory as the pyproject.toml run "python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine" and 
"python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/* --verbose" Then input your username and password
